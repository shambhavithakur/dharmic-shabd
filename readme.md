My interpretations of Sanskrit shlokas

I created this blog to share my interpretations of selected shlokas and discuss how they relate to the present world. If we have any culture today, it is largely because of these shlokas. Their aura always surrounds us. We only have to reach out and acknowledge their power to be blessed and rescued from unfavorable situations.
