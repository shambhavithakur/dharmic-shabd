# Overcoming Obstacles with Lord Ganesh

Lord Ganesh, or God of the people, is worshipped first during any religious ceremony. He has the body of a human and the head of an elephant, and according to scriptures, he helps remove any obstacles that prevent us from achieving our&nbsp;goals.

Goddess Parvati, the wife of Lord Shiva, who is one of the three supreme Gods of the cosmos, created Ganesh using turmeric paste. She was looking for an attendant who would be fiercely loyal to her and give precedence to her words over anyone else's. As none of Shiv's followers fit the bill, Parvati had no option but to give shape to her requirements herself.

The loyal nature of the original Ganesh proved to be his undoing. Lord Shiv beheaded Ganesh in anger when he didn't allow him to meet Goddess Parvati. Shiv's anger thawed only when he discovered that Parvati was devastated and inconsolable. He brought Ganesh back to life, giving him the head of an elephant. He also bestowed on Ganesh the honor of being the first God to be invoked during rituals and at the beginning of any&nbsp;task.

## Relevant Ganesh Shlokas

### वक्र तुंड महाकाय
 
```
वक्रतुण्ड महाकाय सूर्यकोटि समप्रभ ।  
निर्विघ्नं कुरु मे देव सर्वकार्येषु सर्वदा ॥
```

#### Meaning

*Vakra tund mahakaay* is one of the foremost shlokas that we recite to appease Lord Ganesh. We begin by praising his imposing presence and curved trunk and declare that he is as bright as 10 million suns. Then we implore him to always help us complete our good deeds without any problems.

*Vakra tund mahakaay* makes us acknowledge that obstacles are inevitable but not insuperable. It gives us the confidence and the mental strength to embark on each task fully aware that divinity is on our&nbsp;side.

If we are aware and collected, we aren't mired by fear and inhibitions. We acquire the ability to think outside the box. We accept that our paths will not be devoid of obstacles, and we prepare ourselves to face the obstacles. 

!!! quote
    With the power of God, we empower ourselves.

*Vakra tund mahakaay* sets our thought process in motion. It encourages us to take charge and not sit back and relax once we have chanted it. The divine guidance of the shloka gives us the good sense to proactively identify known and unknown risks that can prevent us from achieving our goals. It also gives us the optimism and rationality necessary to find out ways to mitigate or prevent the identified&nbsp;risks.

#### Takeaway

If we start each task with a positive frame of mind, necessary solutions present themselves to us in due course. All we have to do is take the first step forward with a prepared mind and a confident attitude.

### गणनाथ गणेश विघ्नराट्
 
```
गणनाथ गणेश विघ्नराट् शिवसूनो जगदेकसद्गुरो ।  
सुरमानुषगीतमद्यशः प्रणतं मामव संसृतेर्भयात् ॥
``` 

#### Meaning

*Gananaath Ganesh* is again pure praise of Lord Ganesh and a request for his help and protection. We begin by saying that Ganesh, the son of Lord Shiv, is the protector of people and the remover of obstacles. We proclaim that he is the only righteous teacher in the entire world. Then we ask Ganesh, to whom Gods and people alike sing hymns of praise, to protect us from worldly problems and&nbsp;fears.

#### Takeaway

Let us accept a divine power as our true teacher. Let him be Lord Ganesh. If we acquire a protective teacher, we overcome our fears automatically. When we are devoid of fears, the world begins to make sense and our goals become achievable.
