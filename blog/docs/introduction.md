# Introduction

|| श्री गणेशाय नमः ||

Sanskrit writers of ancient times—before the Common Era (CE) and in the early decades of the CE—knew how to praise the cosmos, the earth, and all sentient beings that inhabit the cosmos. They also excelled at praising them in&nbsp;style.

Sanskrit literature is replete with shlokas, or verses, that appeal to and glorify the enchanting and intriguing elements of the cosmos. They present a form of worship that is honest, sincere, and pure and helps us discover the greatness of our own selves and&nbsp;spirits.

It is the power of Sanskrit shlokas that bestowed an aura of knowledge and prosperity on ancient Indians and attracted people from all over the world to the Indian subcontinent. The aura still persists and manifests itself during the moments we turn to these shlokas for ministration during happy and trying&nbsp;times.

I created this blog to share my interpretations of selected shlokas and discuss how they relate to the present world. If we have any culture today, it is largely because of these shlokas. Their aura always surrounds us. We only have to reach out and acknowledge their power to be blessed and rescued from unfavorable situations.
