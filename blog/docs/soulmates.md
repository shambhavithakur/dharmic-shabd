# The Reasons Why You Need Your Soulmate

## The Duet of Your Life

If you were born and raised by people who were dharmic in spirit, it is very likely that you want your soulmate as your life partner. You seek the man or woman who has been in tune with your soul since before this matrix came into being and has given you company in your past lives in this matrix. You feel that the music of your present life can become an enjoyable duet in his or her company&nbsp;alone.

## Rules Matter

There is nothing wrong about your desire to be with your soulmate. You are only trying to adhere to the rules of nature and spirituality about&nbsp;love.

As per the rule of nature, an amorous relationship is meant for a grand total of two compatible human beings. That's why you look for a special someone and not a multitude of people to fill the vacuum of loneliness in your life.

If you just follow the rule of nature, you can make any individual who catches your fancy that special someone. You won't, however, find true moral and spiritual happiness with him or her. That's because you won't be complying with the rule of spirituality.

According to the rule of spirituality, an amorous relationship remains amorous and truly satisfying only if you are with your soulmate. Your subconscious mind is aware of this rule. If it cannot detect in your partner the tune that can make your soul complete—the tune that can make your life's music a soulful duet—it begins to rebel time and again. The result is a relationship that leans heavily on the side of tumultuousness and acrimony rather than love and geniality.

## Ignoring Isn't Bliss

If you ignore the rule of spirituality when you choose your life partner, you will always feel there's something lacking in him or her. You will feel incomplete and clueless, and you will keep looking at the rest of the world for ideas on how to play the music of your life.

Imagine a world where almost every adult was with a partner who wasn't his or her soulmate. This world would be a jumble of signals and a cacophony of sounds because everyone would be trying to play someone else's music—music that they can mimic but cannot really comprehend. Is the world we live in any different? It isn't.

There is turmoil and unhappiness all over the world today because most people choose to ignore the rule of spirituality. They choose to be copycats instead of individualistic, soulful beings, and they force others to cast themselves in the same mold. That's why unnecessary competitiveness, jealousy, and selfishness plague humanity when we could easily have had cordiality, tolerance, and respect for humanity. That's why people are ruthlessly money minded and favor make believe over everything else. The brisk business that nonsensical movies, sitcoms, novels, and mass-media stories are doing is proof enough of this.

## Remedial Action

When the world is running after make believe, what should you do?

If you respect your soul and your individuality, be pious, shun frivolity, and continue looking for your soulmate. Only if you keep your mind focused can you truly own your soul. If you don't, life will become a struggle between you and others for your&nbsp;soul.

Take ownership of what belongs to you. You are aware that you have a soul. Others might be unaware about their souls or they might not possess any soul. They will, inevitably, try to draw knowledge from your soul and hurt you in the process. Don't be deterred and dejected by this and remain focused.

Never forget that true knowledge and reality are with your soul. Don't deprive your human self of this knowledge and reality. Human life is only a matter of playing music, whether tuneful and soulful or cacophonic. Make sure the music of your life is of the former&nbsp;type.

### Tips for Finding Your Soulmate

If you are extremely lucky, your soulmate will automatically be attracted to you. Few people are. Chances are that you will have to actively look for your soulmate. Here are a few tips to help you in your&nbsp;quest:

* **Five years or less**: If you are a man, your soulmate would not be more than five years younger than you. If you are a woman, your soulmate should not be more than five years older than you. An age difference of more than five years takes you into another generation's territory. You won't really find compatibility there. Without compatibility, there is no soulmate.

* **Conception**: A man's soulmate is generally conceived four years after he is born. And a woman's soulmate should have been conceived five years before she was born. Do the&nbsp;math.
  
* **Birthdays**: Be on the lookout for any number that your mind focuses on often, whether in books, in the outside world, or in your imagination. If the number is large enough, subtract your birthday from that number. For example, if you were born on December 11, subtract 11 from that number. Otherwise, add your birthday to the number. The result could be the birthday of your soulmate.  
  
    It is also possible that a number that you see often is a concatenation of the months you and your soulmate were born or conceived. You might also come across numbers that contain a concatenation of you and your soulmate's birth and conception months as well as the sum of your birthdays. Be on the lookout.

* **Positive thinking**: Always think happy thoughts, be helpful and generous, and specify in writing or in your thoughts what you want in your soulmate. He or she might sense your vibes and mold his or her personality accordingly. Soulmates subconsciously try to match each other's requirements because they want to easily recognize each other when they&nbsp;meet.
