# Understanding the Human&nbsp;Soul

## Manifestations of the&nbsp;Soul

Matter is neither created nor destroyed. It only changes form. By the same logic, a soul is neither created nor destroyed. It only manifests itself in different forms, at different points of reference and on different&nbsp;planes.

On the plane that we are on—the Earth—a soul manifests itself as a human being. On another plane, it could manifest itself as something that is totally unfathomable for us. Let us discuss how souls interact with human&nbsp;beings.

## Soulful Interconnections

Your human body is governed by your soul, your subconscious and conscious minds, and the related interconnections. These elements are described below.

* **Soul**: The soul is spiritual energy. It is aware of the existence of your human body and sends guiding signals to it. Your soul has immense knowledge and power and keeps improving and evolving as it ascends the metaphysical planes of the cosmos and reaches the ultimate goal—the ultimate truth. The human body is just another learning avenue for the&nbsp;soul.

* **Subconscious mind**: Your subconscious mind is interconnected with your soul and your conscious mind and is aware of the interconnections. It is your subconscious mind that transfers signals from your soul to your conscious mind and reports to your soul about the activities of your conscious mind.  
  
    It is also the subconscious mind that lets you perform various tasks on autopilot, without any apparent involvement of your conscious mind. For example, if you unthinkingly, but correctly, respond to events on the road when you are driving, you can attribute this to the power of your subconscious mind.
    
    You can call your subconscious mind the unapparent source that can force you to act divine or demonic. In an ideal world, you would always be divine, by&nbsp;the&nbsp;way.
  
* **Conscious mind**: Your conscious mind represents the awareness that makes you a simple human being. It lets you form ideas and perform actions that you can comprehend and make sense of. It is what generates your body and the entire illusion that you consider your reality. Your conscious mind is a form of experience for your soul, and this experience only enriches and strengthens your soul in its journey towards the ultimate&nbsp;truth.

## Demonic Influences

In an ideal world, the transfer of signals between your soul and your subconscious and conscious minds is effortless and uncorrupted. In the world that we inhabit, this isn't so. Demonic forces intercept the connection between your subconscious and conscious minds and disrupt or manipulate the signals that flow to&nbsp;and&nbsp;fro.

### Sattvic, Rajasic, and Tamasic Signals

Your soul sends you sattvic signals—signals that are pure and carry immense knowledge and bliss. Demonic forces can manipulate these pure signals into the following types of impure thoughts:

* **Rajasic**: Rajasic thoughts are related to lust, greed, and attachment and force you to seek personal benefit in every action. For example, they might force you to become obsessed with another individual because of lust or with wealth acquisition because of&nbsp;greed.
* **Tamasic**: Tamasic thoughts cause you to make mistakes and act&nbsp;lazy. For example, they might force your mind to focus on simple sensory perceptions and actions of others, which shouldn't normally distract&nbsp;you.

!!! note
    Don't fear the manipulations of demonic forces. Avoid becoming a slave to anger, lust, and greed. Trust your soul. All else is only an illusion.

## Treading the Right&nbsp;Path

Whenever you feel that demonic forces are getting a hold over you, ask yourself the question, "Is my atma, or soul, money, lust, and greed or is it a mani, or gem?" Believe that your soul is the real gem, the most precious form of existence, and you will return to the right path.

Set your priorities and goals correctly, and your soul becomes your guiding light. Give in to temptation, and you alienate your soul. If you respect your sentience, you will always do what is right, in spite of obstacles, discouragement, and demonic influences.
