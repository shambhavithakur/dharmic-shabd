# Understanding the&nbsp;Soul

## What the Soul Really&nbsp;Is

The soul is sentient spiritual energy. Just as matter in the perceptible universe is neither created nor destroyed, the soul also is neither created nor destroyed. Unlike matter, however, the soul itself doesn't change form. It is imperceptible and formless and can be everywhere in physical space at the same time.

The soul transcends the universe and creation as we know them and is far more knowledgeable and vast than a human mind. The soul has immense knowledge because it is a constant learner. It keeps improving and evolving and ascends the higher, metaphysical planes of the universe and beyond until it reaches the ultimate goal—the ultimate&nbsp;truth.

## Manifestations of the&nbsp;Soul

In its quest for knowledge, the soul manifests itself in different forms, at different points of reference, on each plane that it travels through. On the plane that we are on—physically represented by the Earth—a soul manifests itself as a human being. It could be born and reborn as a human being multiple times on Earth. On another plane, the soul could manifest itself as something that is totally unfathomable&nbsp;for&nbsp;us.

As we are human beings, let us discuss how souls interact with human&nbsp;bodies.

## Soulful Interconnections for&nbsp;Humans

When a soul manifests itself as a human being, it maintains a link with that being through his or her brain. The brain-generated elements that act as nodes in this link are referred to as subconscious and conscious minds. The interconnections that emanate from these minds are described&nbsp;below.

* **Subconscious interconnections**: Your subconscious mind is interconnected with your soul and your conscious mind and is aware of the interconnections. It is your subconscious mind that transfers signals from your soul to your conscious mind and reports to your soul about the activities of your conscious&nbsp;mind.  
  
    It is also the subconscious mind that lets you perform various tasks on autopilot, without any apparent involvement of your conscious mind. For example, if you unthinkingly, but correctly, respond to events on the road when you are driving, you can attribute this to the power of your subconscious&nbsp;mind.
    
    You can call your subconscious mind the unapparent source that can force you to act divine or demonic. In an ideal world, you would always be divine, by&nbsp;the&nbsp;way.
  
* **Conscious interconnections**: Your conscious mind represents the awareness that makes you a simple human being. It lets you form ideas and perform actions that you can comprehend and make sense of. It is what generates your body and the entire illusion that you consider your reality.
  
    Although your conscious mind is interconnected with your subconscious mind, it isn't cognizant of the interconnection. That is how your soul wants it, anyway. The experiences that your conscious mind appears to accumulate independently are also experiences for your soul. These experiences enrich and strengthen your soul in its journey towards the ultimate&nbsp;truth.

## Demonic Influences on Soulful Interconnections

In an ideal world, the transfer of signals between your soul and your subconscious and conscious minds is effortless and uncorrupted. In the world that we inhabit, this isn't so. Demonic forces intercept the connection between your subconscious and conscious minds and disrupt or manipulate the signals that flow to&nbsp;and&nbsp;fro.

What types of signals can the subconscious and conscious minds exchange? Let us find&nbsp;out.

### Distinguishing Between Mental Signals

Three types of signals can flow between your subconscious and conscious minds. These signals are described&nbsp;below.

* ***Sattvic***: Your soul sends *sattvic* signals to your subconscious mind. *Sattvic* signals are pure and carry immense knowledge and bliss. Demonic forces can manipulate these pure signals into impure *rajasic* and *tamasic* thoughts.

* ***Rajasic***: Signals of the *rajasic* type are related to lust, greed, and attachment and force you to seek personal benefit in every action. For example, they might force you to become obsessed with another individual because of lust or with wealth acquisition because of&nbsp;greed.
* ***Tamasic***: Signals of the *Tamasic* type cause you to make mistakes and act&nbsp;lazy. For example, they might force your mind to focus on simple sensory perceptions and actions of others, which shouldn't normally distract&nbsp;you.

!!! note
    Don't fear the manipulations of demonic forces. Avoid becoming a slave to anger, lust, and greed. Trust your soul. All else is only an illusion.

## Overcoming Demons and Treading the Right&nbsp;Path

Whenever you feel that demonic forces are getting a hold over you, ask yourself the question, "Is my *atma*, or soul, money, lust, and greed or is it a *mani*, or gem?" Acknowledge that your soul is the real gem, the most precious form of existence, and you will return to the right&nbsp;path.

If you set your priorities and goals correctly, without letting any greed, lust, anger, or perversion creep in, your soul becomes your guiding light. If you give in to temptation, you alienate your soul. You should respect your sentience and strive to remain friends with your soul. You will then always do what is right, in spite of obstacles, discouragement, and demonic influences.
