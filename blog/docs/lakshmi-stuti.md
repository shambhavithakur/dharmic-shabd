# Finding Prosperity with Goddess Lakshmi

According to Sanskrit scriptures, the worship of Goddess Lakshmi bestows us with wealth and prosperity. Lakshmi is said to be the wife of Lord Vishnu, who is one of the three supreme Gods of the cosmos. Vishnu means the one who is present everywhere. His wife should also, logically, be everywhere. Lakshmi and prosperity are always within reach on our generous earth. It is the selfishness of people that causes disbalance and a lack of wealth. We pray to Goddess Lakshmi to get the confidence to overcome this disbalance without becoming degraded ourselves.
