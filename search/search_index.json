He has the body of a human and the head of an elephant, and according to scriptures, he helps remove any obstacles that prevent us from achieving our goals. Goddess Parvati, the wife of Lord Shiva, who is one of the three supreme Gods of the cosmos, created Ganesh using turmeric paste. She was looking for an attendant who would be fiercely loyal to her and give precedence to her words over anyone else's. As none of Shiv's followers fit the bill, Parvati had no option but to give shape to her requirements herself. The loyal nature of the original Ganesh proved to be his undoing. Lord Shiv beheaded Ganesh in anger when he didn't allow him to meet Goddess Parvati. Shiv's anger thawed only when he discovered that Parvati was devastated and inconsolable. He brought Ganesh back to life, giving him the head of an elephant. He also bestowed on Ganesh the honor of being the first God to be invoked during rituals and at the beginning of any task.

We begin by praising his imposing presence and curved trunk and declare that he is as bright as 10 million suns. Then we implore him to always help us complete our good deeds without any problems. Vakra tund mahakaay makes us acknowledge that obstacles are inevitable but not insuperable. It gives us the confidence and the mental strength to embark on each task fully aware that divinity is on our side. If we are aware and collected, we aren't mired by fear and inhibitions. We acquire the ability to think outside the box. We accept that our paths will not be devoid of obstacles, and we prepare ourselves to face the obstacles. Quote With the power of God, we empower ourselves. Vakra tund mahakaay sets our thought process in motion. It encourages us to take charge and not sit back and relax once we have chanted it. The divine guidance of the shloka gives us the good sense to proactively identify known and unknown risks that can prevent us from achieving our goals. It also gives us the optimism and rationality necessary to find out ways to mitigate or prevent the identified risks. Takeaway \u00b6 If we start each task with a positive frame of mind, necessary solutions present themselves to us in due course. All we have to do is take the first step forward with a prepared mind and a confident attitude. \u0917\u0923\u0928\u093e\u0925 \u0917\u0923\u0947\u0936 \u0935\u093f\u0918\u094d\u0928\u0930\u093e\u091f\u094d \u00b6 \u0917\u0923\u0928\u093e\u0925 \u0917\u0923\u0947\u0936 \u0935\u093f\u0918\u094d\u0928\u0930\u093e\u091f\u094d \u0936\u093f\u0935\u0938\u0942\u0928\u094b \u091c\u0917\u0926\u0947\u0915\u0938\u0926\u094d\u0917\u0941\u0930\u094b \u0964 \u0938\u0941\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0941\u0937\u0917\u0940\u0924\u092e\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0936\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0923\u0924\u0902 \u092e\u093e\u092e\u0935 \u0938\u0902\u0938\u0943\u0924\u0947\u0930\u094d\u092d\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d \u0965 Meaning \u00b6 Gananaath Ganesh is again pure praise of Lord Ganesh and a request for his help and protection. We begin by saying that Ganesh, the son of Lord Shiv, is the protector of people and the remover of obstacles. We proclaim that he is the only righteous teacher in the entire world. Then we ask Ganesh, to whom Gods and people alike sing hymns of praise, to protect us from worldly problems and fears. Takeaway \u00b6 Let us accept a divine power as our true teacher. Let him be Lord Ganesh. If we acquire a protective teacher, we overcome our fears automatically. When we are devoid of fears, the world begins to make sense and our goals become achievable.","title":"Overcoming Obstacles with Lord Ganesh"},{"location":"ganesh-stuti/#overcoming-obstacles-with-lord-ganesh","text":"Lord Ganesh, or God of the people, is worshipped first during any religious ceremony.

Lakshmi is said to be the wife of Lord Vishnu, who is one of the three supreme Gods of the cosmos. Vishnu means the one who is present everywhere. His wife should also, logically, be everywhere. Lakshmi and prosperity are always within reach on our generous earth. It is the selfishness of people that causes disbalance and a lack of wealth.

You seek the man or woman who has been in tune with your soul since before this matrix came into being and has given you company in your past lives in this matrix. You feel that the music of your present life can become an enjoyable duet in his or her company alone. Rules Matter \u00b6 There is nothing wrong about your desire to be with your soulmate. You are only trying to adhere to the rules of nature and spirituality about love. As per the rule of nature, an amorous relationship is meant for a grand total of two compatible human beings. That's why you look for a special someone and not a multitude of people to fill the vacuum of loneliness in your life. If you just follow the rule of nature, you can make any individual who catches your fancy that special someone. You won't, however, find true moral and spiritual happiness with him or her. That's because you won't be complying with the rule of spirituality. According to the rule of spirituality, an amorous relationship remains amorous and truly satisfying only if you are with your soulmate. Your subconscious mind is aware of this rule. If it cannot detect in your partner the tune that can make your soul complete\u2014the tune that can make your life's music a soulful duet\u2014it begins to rebel time and again. The result is a relationship that leans heavily on the side of tumultuousness and acrimony rather than love and geniality. Ignoring Isn't Bliss \u00b6 If you ignore the rule of spirituality when you choose your life partner, you will always feel there's something lacking in him or her. You will feel incomplete and clueless, and you will keep looking at the rest of the world for ideas on how to play the music of your life. Imagine a world where almost every adult was with a partner who wasn't his or her soulmate. This world would be a jumble of signals and a cacophony of sounds because everyone would be trying to play someone else's music\u2014music that they can mimic but cannot really comprehend. Is the world we live in any different? It isn't. There is turmoil and unhappiness all over the world today because most people choose to ignore the rule of spirituality. They choose to be copycats instead of individualistic, soulful beings, and they force others to cast themselves in the same mold. That's why unnecessary competitiveness, jealousy, and selfishness plague humanity when we could easily have had cordiality, tolerance, and respect for humanity. That's why people are ruthlessly money minded and favor make believe over everything else. The brisk business that nonsensical movies, sitcoms, novels, and mass-media stories are doing is proof enough of this. Remedial Action \u00b6 When the world is running after make believe, what should you do? If you respect your soul and your individuality, be pious, shun frivolity, and continue looking for your soulmate. Only if you keep your mind focused can you truly own your soul. If you don't, life will become a struggle between you and others for your soul. Take ownership of what belongs to you. You are aware that you have a soul. Others might be unaware about their souls or they might not possess any soul. They will, inevitably, try to draw knowledge from your soul and hurt you in the process. Don't be deterred and dejected by this and remain focused. Never forget that true knowledge and reality are with your soul. Don't deprive your human self of this knowledge and reality. Human life is only a matter of playing music, whether tuneful and soulful or cacophonic. Make sure the music of your life is of the former type. Tips for Finding Your Soulmate \u00b6 If you are extremely lucky, your soulmate will automatically be attracted to you. Few people are. Chances are that you will have to actively look for your soulmate. Here are a few tips to help you in your quest: Five years or less : If you are a man, your soulmate would not be more than five years younger than you. If you are a woman, your soulmate should not be more than five years older than you. An age difference of more than five years takes you into another generation's territory. You won't really find compatibility there. Without compatibility, there is no soulmate. Conception : A man's soulmate is generally conceived four years after he is born. And a woman's soulmate should have been conceived five years before she was born. Do the math. Birthdays : Be on the lookout for any number that your mind focuses on often, whether in books, in the outside world, or in your imagination. If the number is large enough, subtract your birthday from that number. For example, if you were born on December 11, subtract 11 from that number. Otherwise, add your birthday to the number. The result could be the birthday of your soulmate. It is also possible that a number that you see often is a concatenation of the months you and your soulmate were born or conceived. You might also come across numbers that contain a concatenation of you and your soulmate's birth and conception months as well as the sum of your birthdays. Be on the lookout. Positive thinking : Always think happy thoughts, be helpful and generous, and specify in writing or in your thoughts what you want in your soulmate. He or she might sense your vibes and mold his or her personality accordingly. Soulmates subconsciously try to match each other's requirements because they want to easily recognize each other when they meet.","title":"The Reasons Why You Need Your Soulmate"},{"location":"soulmates/#the-reasons-why-you-need-your-soulmate","text":"","title":"The Reasons Why You Need Your Soulmate"},{"location":"soulmates/#the-duet-of-your-life","text":"If you were born and raised by people who were dharmic in spirit, it is very likely that you want your soulmate as your life partner.
